# Decisions — samaroh-web

Contract clarifications and notable implementation decisions, newest first.
(The product spec stays the source of truth; entries here record how this
repo interprets it where the spec leaves web-specific latitude.)

## 2026-08-26 — WW-2: Menu, Reports, PWA/outbox, e2e, Vercel

- **Service worker: hand-rolled, not next-pwa/Workbox.** `next-pwa` is not
  maintained against the App Router and Workbox would add a build-time
  dependency for ~60 lines of logic. `public/sw.js` implements exactly the
  spec's web contract (§1.2): network-first navigations with cache fallback
  (read-only offline cache) and cache-first hashed assets. It never touches
  POST/PATCH traffic or cross-origin (Supabase) calls — queued writes are the
  Dexie outbox's job (`src/lib/outbox/`). Registered in production builds only.
- **Offline writes (web scope).** The §8 outbox semantics are mirrored for the
  mutations a user can meaningfully perform offline: booking create/edit/
  cancel/payment/date-blocks, expense entries/parties, inventory *add*
  transactions. Ops carry client UUIDs (idempotent replay), FIFO order, and a
  `base_updated_at` LWW guard; losers become visible `conflict` entries on
  Settings → Sync status, never silent drops. Online-only by design:
  inventory *remove* (needs a live read of open FIFO lots), member/business
  admin, storage uploads and invoice-number assignment (server-side counter).
  Reads stay online-backed (spec: web offline is *read-only cache + queued
  writes*, not a full local database).
- **Reports interpretation (§4.4).** Date filter = booking overlap with the
  range (start-month attribution for revenue); "profit" is cash-basis
  (payments received minus `paid` ledger entries, `received` entries count as
  income); "collection efficiency" clamps early settlements to 0 days;
  CSV export only on web (PDF export remains Android's share flow; the web
  counterpart is `Download CSV` per the shared catalog).
- **Web Settings scope.** Reminders, backup scheduling and dynamic color are
  Android-platform features (DataStore / WorkManager / Material You A12+) and
  are not shown on web. Google account linking renders as a stub row in the
  "not configured" state until a Google OAuth client is provisioned
  (deployment concern, see README → Deploying).
- **Playwright e2e runs hermetically** against a production build started
  without Supabase env vars (guarded client contract). The authenticated
  booking-calendar spec activates only when `E2E_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `E2E_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `E2E_EMAIL`, `E2E_PASSWORD` are provided. CI keeps
  the e2e job separate from the required quality gate (promote once stable).
- **Email sign-up + first-run business creation (web).** The sign-in page gains
  a sign-up mode (Supabase `signUp`; ≥6-char client check mirrors the GoTrue
  default). With email confirmation enabled the app shows a localized
  confirm-email notice and returns to sign-in; duplicate emails are detected
  via the obfuscated empty-`identities` response. After the first
  authenticated session with no visible business, the same screen collects
  business name/type/address/owner and inserts the `businesses` row
  (`owner_user_id = auth.uid()`, per the 002 RLS insert policy) plus the
  active owner `business_members` row (allowed because `is_owner()` checks
  `businesses.owner_user_id` directly) — no schema/RLS change was needed.
  Suggested business types are localized labels stored as free text
  (`business_type` column contract).
- **Guest mode (web).** "Continue offline" on the sign-in page sets the
  `samaroh_guest` cookie (middleware lets it through route protection) and
  swaps `createClient()` to a Dexie-backed local client implementing the
  PostgREST query subset the app uses — feature screens run unchanged and no
  data leaves the device. A persistent banner (all app screens, incl.
  reports) states the this-device-only scope with a sign-in CTA. The outbox
  never queues or replays against the local client (queued writes belong to a
  signed-in session). A real session supersedes guest mode; local guest data
  stays on-device and is NOT migrated to the account (revisit post-Wave-2 if
  demanded). Strings live in the shared `web-auth` fragment.
